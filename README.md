# PINN 2D Phase Change  
This folder contains codes of physics-informed neural network and finite volume code for phase change problems. The details regarding the implementation of the code are presented in the paper.  

# PINN Architecture

- Skip connections are incorporated in the network architecture.  
- The neural network takes **spatial and temporal coordinates** as input.  
- The network outputs the **temperature field** as the prediction.  
- The model is trained using **physics-informed loss functions** derived from governing equations.
